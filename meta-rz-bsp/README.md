# meta-rz-bsp

This meta-layer provides a basic BSP that will build a simple, usable image for
Renesas RZ reference platforms.

It is designed to allow users to use the latest upstream open source projects
and is provided as-is with no support from Renesas.

For fully supported and fully functional software from Renesas please use the
official BSPs provided on [renesas.com](https://renesas.com).

Further information about this meta-layer can be found in the top-level
[README.md](../README.md) of this repository.
