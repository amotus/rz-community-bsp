# rz-community-bsp
This repository provides a basic BSP that will build a simple, usable image
for Renesas RZ reference platforms and SolidRun RZ/G2LC EVK.

It is designed to allow users to use the latest upstream open source projects
and is provided as-is with no support from Renesas.

For supported and fully functional software from Renesas please use the
official BSPs provided on [renesas.com](https://renesas.com).

## Building
This project is set up to be built with [Kas](https://github.com/siemens/kas).
The Kas tool provides an easy mechanism to setup bitbake based projects.
Documentation for Kas is available on [readthedocs.io](
https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide.html).

### kas-container
The easiest way to use Kas is to use `kas-container`. This script will run the
Bitbake built in a pre-configured Docker container.

For ease of use a copy of the script has been included in this repository.

### Kas Menu
Kas supports a Kconfig based menu system which can be accessed with the
`kas menu` (or `kas-container menu`) command. This allows users to easily select
between options without having to manually select the kas yaml files required
for their build.

Follow the instuctions in the menu to select the build configuration and then
either "Save & Build" to save the configuration to a .config.yaml file and kick
off a build straight way, or "Save & Exit" to only store the configuration to a
.config.yaml file for future use.

Example kas menu usage:
```bash
# Make sure we're inside rz-community-bsp (this repository)
cd rz-community-bsp

./kas-container menu
```

If you exit the kas menu screen without selecting "Save & Build" you can
subsequently start a build:
```bash
./kas-container build
```

Alternitively you can start a shell within the kas build environment that has
already been configured for use with bitbake, with all dependencies checked out:
```bash
./kas-container shell
```

### Kas with Configuraiton Fragments
The build can also be configured using a number of options provided in different
kas yaml files. They can be daisy chained onto each other so that multple
options can be selected.

**kas/base.yml**\
This file adds in the base configuration used by this project. It is
automatically included by the yocto version yaml files (see below).

**kas/yocto/*.yml**\
This includes the dependency configuration for building the rz-community-bsp
based on specific versions of Yocto.

**kas/machine/*.yml**\
A selection of files to use to specify which machine to build for.

**kas/image/*.yml**\
A selection of files to use to specify which image to build.

**kas/kernel/*.yml**\
A selection of files to use to specify which Linux kernel version to build.

**kas/u-boot/*.yml**\
A selection of files to use to specify which U-Boot version to build.

**kas/trusted-firmware-a/*.yml**\
A selection of files to use to specify which Trusted-Firmware-A version to build.

**kas/opt/gitlab-ci-cache.yml**\
A special option that can be used to configure the sstate and downloads
directory locations so that they can be used easily with GitLab CI/CD caching.

**kas/opt/debug.yml**\
Add various features to the image to help with development and debugging.\
Specifically, it enables the *debug-tweaks* image feature that allows users to\
be able to login without a password. More information can be found\
[here](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev/ref-manual/features.html#:~:text=debug%2Dtweaks%3A%20Makes%20an%20image,enables%20post%2Dinstallation%20logging).

Example usage:
```bash
# Make sure we're inside rz-community-bsp (this repository)
cd rz-community-bsp

# Yocto: kirkstone
# Image: renesas-image-minimal
# Machine: hihope-rzg2h
# Linux: linux-renesas v5.10
./kas-container build kas/yocto/kirkstone.yml:kas/opt/debug.yml:kas/image/renesas-image-minimal.yml:kas/machine/hihope-rzg2h.yml:kas/kernel/renesas-5.10.yml

# Yocto: kirkstone
# Image: renesas-image-minimal
# Machine: smarc-rzg2l
# Linux: linux-cip v6.1
./kas-container build kas/yocto/kirkstone.yml:kas/opt/debug.yml:kas/image/renesas-image-minimal.yml:kas/machine/smarc-rzg2l.yml:kas/kernel/cip-6.1.yml

# If you are re-building in the same directory as a previous build it may be
# prudent to use --update and --force-checkout to ensure that the dependency
# repositories are correct
./kas-container build --update --force-checkout kas/yocto/kirkstone.yml:kas/opt/debug.yml:kas/image/renesas-image-minimal.yml:kas/machine/hihope-rzg2h.yml:kas/kernel/cip-6.1.yml
```

## Building the SDK
In order to (cross) compile applications to run on the flashed image an SDK is
needed. Yocto provides a way to build this SDK and create a suitable installer
for your build machine.

The architecture (e.g. x86_64, aarch64) of the machine where the SDK is to be
used can be set in local.conf with the `SDKMACHINE` variable. It can also be
configured in the kas menu.

To build the SDK installer package run the following, replacing
`renesas-image-minimal` with the target image of your choice:
```bash
bitbake renesas-image-minimal -c populate_sdk
```

The SDK installer (the \*.sh file) will be output to the standard deploy
directory. Here is an example:
```bash
ls tmp/deploy/sdk
poky-glibc-x86_64-renesas-image-minimal-cortexa55-smarc-rzg2l-toolchain-4.0.16.host.manifest
poky-glibc-x86_64-renesas-image-minimal-cortexa55-smarc-rzg2l-toolchain-4.0.16.sh
poky-glibc-x86_64-renesas-image-minimal-cortexa55-smarc-rzg2l-toolchain-4.0.16.target.manifest
poky-glibc-x86_64-renesas-image-minimal-cortexa55-smarc-rzg2l-toolchain-4.0.16.testdata.json
```
